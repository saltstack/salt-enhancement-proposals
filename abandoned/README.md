# Abandoned SEPs

SEPs here have been abandoned, or rejected without prejudice. They may be
fundamentally sound, or need major reworking, or the author may have had
other priorities in their life.

In any case, they are up for grabs - if you like an idea here and you
believe in it, you can adopt the SEP. Take it home with you, look at the
comments on the original PR, figure out what needs to happen to get this SEP
into shape, and create a new PR that references the original PR.
